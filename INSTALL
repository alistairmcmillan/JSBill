To install:
	./configure
	make
	make install

Notes:
 - libXpm is required when using Motif or Athena widgets.  If you don't
   have it, get it from any X ftp site.

 - By default, xbill will be detect the presence of GTK, Motif, and Athena
   widgets, and build with all that are present.  It will also use Xaw3d
   as a replacement for the standard Athena sidgets if present.

 - The default UI is GTK, if compiled in, followed by Motif and Athena.
